# **Sales-Data-Analysis**

## üìå **Project Overview**
The e-commerce industry is rapidly expanding worldwide. By examining data from a virtual e-commerce platform, we can uncover key insights into sales trends and market growth. This analysis offers an objective perspective on different product categories, highlighting those most appealing to online shoppers. It also assesses the impact of promotional strategies on product performance and evaluates profitability, equipping the company with valuable data to make informed decisions for future sales periods.


## ‚ùì **Problem Statement**
1. How can you write a SQL query to calculate the total sales of furniture products, grouped by each quarter of the year, and order the results chronologically?
2. How can you analyze the impact of different discount levels on sales performance across product categories, specifically looking at the number of orders and total profit generated for each discount classification?

No Discount = 0 

0 < Low Discount < 0.2 

0.2 < Medium Discount < 0.5 

High Discount > 0.5

4. How can you determine the top-performing product categories within each customer segment based on sales and profit, focusing specifically on those categories that rank within the top two for profitability?
5. How can you create a report that displays each employee's performance across different product categories, showing not only the total profit per category but also what percentage of their total profit each category represents, with the results ordered by the percentage in descending order for each employee?
6. How can you develop a user-defined function in SQL Server to calculate the profitability ratio for each product category an employee has sold, and then apply this function to generate a report that ranks each employee's product categories by their profitability ratio?

## üõ†Ô∏è **Skills Demonstrated**

The executed SQL query calculates the total sales of furniture products, grouped by each quarter of the year and ordered chronologically. Below are key observations from the output:

- Consistent Growth Over Time: The total sales figures exhibit a generally increasing trend across the years, indicating a growing demand for furniture products.

- Seasonal Fluctuations: Sales vary significantly between quarters, with Q4 (October‚ÄìDecember) consistently showing the highest sales figures. This pattern suggests increased demand during the holiday season.

- Yearly Trends: Each subsequent year generally records higher total sales than the previous, highlighting a positive growth trajectory for the furniture product category.

- These insights can help businesses optimize inventory management, tailor marketing strategies for peak seasons, and allocate resources more efficiently to maximize revenue.
